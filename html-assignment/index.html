        Hey, this is shah zeb. Im from Pakistan. I just moved to Canada on 24<sup>th</sup>of Aug. I have been trying to do this assignment for the last 18 hours. I was stuck in the initial stages of github and visual code. Then I deleted everything and started it all over again. It was frustrating but glad it worked.

I studied basics of <strong><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr></strong>, but then again it was basic. I am thinking of choosing Web Dev as major. Though it would be harder, I will still try my best. There is this famous quote that:<br>
