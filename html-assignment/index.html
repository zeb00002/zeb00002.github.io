        Hey, this is shah zeb. Im from Pakistan. I just moved to Canada on 24<sup>th</sup>of Aug. I have been trtying to do this assignment for the last 18 hours. I was stuck in the initial stages of github and visual code.

        I do have history with web development but that was with notepad ++ and it was relatively simpler.Github is way too complex.
